## Key Features

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Implementation of bounded contexts and domain models.
- Separation of concerns for clean and maintainable code.

### 2. Microservices
- Independent services communicating via REST APIs and Kafka.
- Designed for scalability and fault tolerance.

### 3. Spring Boot Framework
- Utilization of Spring Boot for rapid development.
- Key modules used: Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Web.

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Integration with **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous communication.

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests written with **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
